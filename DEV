    1.1 Task management
    
        Purposes: storing tasks and managing due dates. One document can have
        many due dates. Direct tasks, such as payment due, or contract
        validation date, or several meeting dates per invitation letter.

        One solution can be using a multy purpose "attache" like method,
        attaching task/duedate/... to a document. Each kind of item should have
        the same interface, so on system wide we could use the provided
        information.

        Where should we use these information?
